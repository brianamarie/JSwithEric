# JSwithEric
Inspired By David Laing's Javascript Koans
[Javascript koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans), the goal of the
Javascript tests is to teach you Javascript programming through
immediate feedback, and differentiation.

When you first run the tests, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a
stack trace indicating where the error occurred. Your goal is to make the
error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about the
Javascript language and functional programming in general.

Order:

Javascript Primitives
Bonus: Skip Down to AboutArrays for the JS Koans on Arrays. Only do this if all concepts are very unfamiliar.
IntroFunctions
LearningAboutHigherOrderFunctions
WritingHigherOrderFunctions

## Running the Koans
Simply navigate to the Javascript Koans folder using a file browser, and
double click on KoansRunnner.html. 

Any browser will do, but for the best results Firefox or Chrome is
recommended. More stack trace information shows up for javascript on these
browsers.

The first error will be in tests/JavascriptPrimitives.js. Fix the first test and
refresh the browser. Rinse and repeat until all tests turn green.

The test runner used is [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) with a customized report viewer.
